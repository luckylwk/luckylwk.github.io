Comparison of different **Named Entity Recognition** (NER) tools and APIs.

* NLTK (Python)
* SpaCy (Python)
* Stanford NER (Java)
* Alchemy by IBM (API)
* Indico.io (API)
* Intellexer (API)
* Cogito (API)
* Saplo (API)
* TextRazor (API)

To test all of these tools I have selected three pieces of text:

* "Israeli PM condemns video of Jewish extremists celebrating toddler's death"
* "Duchy Originals forced to buy back shares from Prince Charles's charitable foundation"
* "The king was returning that day to his Versailles, a 118-room snowbird’s paradise that will become a winter White House if he is elected president. Mar-a-Lago is where Mr. Trump comes to escape, entertain and luxuriate in a Mediterranean-style manse, built 90 years ago by the cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post."

The aim of the whole blog is two-fold. Firstly it just serves to compare the libraries/API's on NER. Secondly I was curious to explore if it may get 'better' when dealing with a larger body of text (i.e., a paragraph), although I could probably have selected a better paragraph to properly explore this.

To start we use two single sentences to get an idea of how well it would perform on news-headlines. The first one we are going to run through all the extractors is 

*"Duchy Originals forced to buy back shares from Prince Charles's charitable foundation"*

<table class="tb">
	<tr>
		<td>NLTK</td>
		<td><span class="entity">Duchy</span> <span class="entity">Originals</span> forced to buy back shares from <span class="entity">Prince</span> <span class="entity">Charles</span>'s charitable foundation</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Stanford NER</td>
		<td>Duchy Originals forced to buy back shares from <span class="entity location">Prince</span> <span class="entity location">Charles</span>'s charitable foundation</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>SpaCy</td>
		<td>Duchy Originals forced to buy back shares from <span class="entity">Prince Charles</span>'s charitable foundation</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Alchemy (API)</td>
		<td><span class="entity">Duchy Originals</span> forced to buy back shares from <span class="entity">Prince Charles</span>'s charitable foundation</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Indico.io (API)</td>
		<td><span class="entity">Duchy</span> Originals forced to buy back shares from <span class="entity">Prince Charles</span>'s charitable foundation</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Saplo (API)</td>
		<td><span class="entity">Duchy</span> Originals forced to buy back shares from <span class="entity">Prince Charles</span>'s charitable foundation</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Intellexer (API)</td>
		<td>Duchy Originals forced to buy back shares from <span class="entity">Prince Charles</span>'s charitable foundation</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>TextRazor (API)</td>
		<td><span class="entity">Duchy</span> Originals forced to buy back shares from <span class="entity">Prince Charles</span>'s <span class="entity">charitable foundation</span></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Cogito (API)</td>
		<td>Duchy Originals forced to buy back shares from Prince <span class="entity">Charles</span>'s charitable foundation</td>
	</tr>
</table>

The second sentence we'll try is

*"Tories in civil war as Duncan Smith attacks austerity programme"*

<table class="tb">
	<tr>
		<td>NLTK</td>
		<td>Tories in civil war as <span class="entity person">Duncan Smith</span> attacks austerity programme</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Stanford NER</td>
		<td>Tories in civil war as <span class="entity person">Duncan Smith</span> attacks austerity programme</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>SpaCy</td>
		<td>Tories in civil war as <span class="entity person">Duncan Smith</span> attacks austerity programme</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Alchemy (API)</td>
		<td>Tories in <span class="entity other">civil war</span> as <span class="entity person">Duncan Smith</span> attacks austerity programme</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Indico.io (API)</td>
		<td><span class="entity location">Tories</span> in civil war as <span class="entity unknown">Duncan Smith</span> attacks austerity programme</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Saplo (API)</td>
		<td><span class="entity person">Tories</span> in civil war as <span class="entity person">Duncan Smith</span> attacks austerity programme</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Intellexer (API)</td>
		<td>Tories in civil war as <span class="entity person">Duncan Smith</span> attacks austerity programme</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>TextRazor (API)</td>
		<td><span class="entity organisation">Tories</span> in civil war as <span class="entity person">Duncan Smith</span> attacks austerity programme</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Cogito (API)</td>
		<td>Tories in civil war as <span class="entity person">Duncan Smith</span> attacks austerity programme</td>
	</tr>
</table>

In addition to the sentences we explored earlier I'll now see how well they can deal with a paragraph of text. The paragraph we will use for this is:

*"The king was returning that day to his Versailles, a 118-room snowbird’s paradise that will become a winter White House if he is elected president. Mar-a-Lago is where Mr. Trump comes to escape, entertain and luxuriate in a Mediterranean-style manse, built 90 years ago by the cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post."*

<table class="tb">
	<tr>
		<td>NLTK</td>
		<td>The king was returning that day to his <span class="entity location">Versailles</span>, a 118-room snowbird’s paradise that will become a winter <span class="entity facility">White House</span> if he is elected president. Mar-a-Lago is where Mr. Trump comes to escape, entertain and luxuriate in a Mediterranean-style manse, built 90 years ago by the cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>

### Conclusion

I don't really have any conclusion, I merely wanted to see how different tools/API's performed on text.
