### Install LuaJIT

Download current LuaJIT from http://luajit.org/download.html. For the installation of LuaJIT I mainly followed the instructions on http://luajit.org/install.html#posix

~~~bash
$ tar zxf LuaJIT-2.0.4.tar.gz
$ cd LuaJIT-2.0.4

$ make
==== Building LuaJIT 2.0.4 ====
/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/make -C src
... 
OK        Successfully built LuaJIT
==== Successfully built LuaJIT 2.0.4 ====

$ sudo make install
...
==== Successfully installed LuaJIT 2.0.4 to /usr/local ====
~~~


### Install Torch

http://torch.ch/docs/getting-started.html

Install all the dependencies.

~~~bash
$ curl -sk https://raw.githubusercontent.com/torch/ezinstall/master/install-deps | bash
==> This script will install:
/usr/local/bin/brew
...
==> Torch7's dependencies have been installed
~~~

To install in `~/torch`

~~~bash
$ git clone https://github.com/torch/distro.git ~/torch --recursive
Cloning into '/Users/XXX/torch'...
remote: Counting objects: 448, done.
...
Checking connectivity... done.
Submodule path 'pkg/xlua': checked out '775ed6c39195470da876ab111bf02cc6b790e04e'

$ cd ~/torch; ./install.sh
...
Updating manifest for /Users/XXX/torch/install/lib/luarocks/rocks
itorch scm-1 is now built and installed in /Users/XXX/torch/install/ (license: BSD)



Not updating your shell profile.
You might want to
add the following lines to your shell profile:

export PATH=/Users/XXX/torch/install/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Users/XXX/torch/install/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Users/XXX/torch/install/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
~~~

Both **Torch** and **LuaJIT** are now installed.

### Torch Packages

New packages can be installed using **Luarocks** from the command-line:

~~~bash
$ luarocks install image
Installing https://raw.githubusercontent.com/torch/rocks/master/image-1.1.alpha-0.rockspec...
...
image 1.1.alpha-0 is now built and installed in /Users/lrwderksen/torch/install/ (license: BSD)


$ luarocks list
image
   1.1.alpha-0 (installed) - /Users/lrwderksen/torch/install/lib/luarocks/rocks
~~~

### Torch Shell

To enter the Torch shell type `th`

~~~torch
$ th

  ______             __   |  Torch7
 /_  __/__  ________/ /   |  Scientific computing for Lua.
  / / / _ \/ __/ __/ _ \  |  Type ? for help
 /_/  \___/_/  \__/_//_/  |  https://github.com/torch
                          |  http://torch.ch

~~~th
th> a = 10
                                                                      [0.0000s]
th> print(a)
10
                                                                      [0.0000s]
~~~

### Torch Script

~~~bash
$ th -h
Usage: th [options] [script.lua [arguments]]

Options:
  -l name            load library name
  -e statement       execute statement
  -h,--help          print this help
  -a,--async         preload async (libuv) and start async repl (BETA)
  -g,--globals       monitor global variables (print a warning on creation/access)
  -gg,--gglobals     monitor global variables (throw an error on creation/access)
  -x,--gfx           start gfx server and load gfx env
  -i,--interactive   enter the REPL after executing a script
~~~

Run a script using the first set of the [Torch Tutorials](https://github.com/torch/tutorials/blob/master/1_getstarted/getstarted.lua)

~~~torch
print('basic printing')
a = 10
print(a)
print 'something'
print(type(a))
print(type('something'))
~~~

~~~bash
$ th tutorial-1.lua
basic printing
10
something
number
string
~~~


### Running iTorch

Based on **IPython** there is a notebook version for Torch provided by Facebook. For more information see [https://github.com/facebook/iTorch](https://github.com/facebook/iTorch).

You can start the notebook by typing `itorch notebook` in the console. You can also enter the shell using `itorch`.

~~~bash
$ itorch notebook
[I 20:13:27.920 NotebookApp] Using existing profile dir: u'/Users/lrwderksen/.ipython/profile_default'
[I 20:13:27.927 NotebookApp] Using MathJax from CDN: https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js
[W 20:13:27.961 NotebookApp] Terminals not available (error was No module named terminado)
